### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity for me to get back into front-end development after a long break (around 1.5 years without practice). My main goal was to refresh my knowledge of fundamental HTML and CSS concepts.

**Key takeaways:**

*   **Skills Refresher:** I successfully recalled how to apply semantic HTML and basic CSS styles effectively.
*   **CSS Variables Practice:** I utilized CSS custom properties for managing colors based on the provided style guide.
*   **Flexbox Centering:** I practiced modern element centering using Flexbox, which made aligning the card straightforward.

I am proud that I was able to complete the challenge independently and restore my foundational skills.
